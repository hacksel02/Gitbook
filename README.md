Hi, I'm hacksel02!

I'm a Level 3 SOC (Security Operations Center) Analyst with three years of experience in monitoring, detecting, and mitigating cybersecurity threats. In my role, I have gained experience in incident response, handling everything from initial detection to containment, eradication, and recovery. I thrive in fast-paced environments where quick thinking and deep technical knowledge are essential, always looking for innovative ways to strengthen an organization's security posture.

Beyond my day-to-day work, I'm passionate about Red Teaming—the art of simulating advanced cyberattacks to test and improve an organization's defenses. This passion extends to participating in Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions and platforms like Hack The Box, where I can challenge my skills, learn from others, and stay up to date with the latest attack vectors and tactics.

I am dedicated to continuous growth in cybersecurity. I've already obtained the BTL1  and BTL2 certifications, which have strengthened my understanding of both defensive security practices. I'm always eager to learn more, pursue new certifications, and push the boundaries of my expertise.In this Git, I'll be sharing insights and experiences from pursuing these certifications, along with practical advice and resources to help you prepare for them.

Additionally, this Git will contain a wealth of information on various attack techniques and important commands, whether it's for penetration testing, forensic analysis, incident response or other areas of cybersecurity. My goal is to provide useful knowledge and tools for anyone looking to deepen their understanding of the field or enhance their practical skills.
